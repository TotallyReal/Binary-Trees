# ðŸŒ³ A Game About Binary Trees

A small experimental game designed to **gamify the learning process** of binary trees.

## ðŸŽ® Current Features

This is a very early version â€” just the bare bones for now:

1. **Radial Binary Search Tree Generation**
   - Each node can have up to **two children**, positioned radially outward from their parent.
   - **Edges** are color-coded:
     - ðŸ”´ **Red** for smaller values (left child)
     - ðŸ”µ **Blue** for larger values (right child)
   - This color scheme reflects how **binary search** works.

2. **Tree Rotations**
   - You can perform standard **left** and **right rotations** to balance the tree, just like in AVL trees.

3. **The Goal (for now)**
   - Make the tree **balanced**, using as **few rotations** and as **little time** as possible.
   - A tree is considered **well-balanced** if **each nodeâ€™s children subtrees differ in height by at most 1**.
