# ðŸŒ³ A Game About Binary Trees

A small experimental game designed to **gamify the learning process** of binary trees.

## ðŸŽ® Current Features

This is a very early version â€” just the bare bones for now:

1. **Radial Binary Search Tree Generation**
   - Each node can have up to **two children**, positioned radially outward from their parent.
   - **Edges** are color-coded:
     - ðŸ”´ **Red** for smaller values (left child)
     - ðŸ”µ **Blue** for larger values (right child)
   - This color scheme reflects how **binary search** works.

2. **Tree Rotations**
   - Pressing the nodes, you can perform standard **tree rotations** (node always moves inwards) to balance the tree, just like in AVL trees.

3. **The Goal (for now)**
   - Make the tree **well-balanced**, using as **few rotations** and as **little time** as possible.
   - A node is called **balanced** if **its left and right subtree's height differ by at most 1**.
   - A tree is considered **well-balanced** if **all of its nodes are balanced**.
   - Unbalanced nodes are marked in red.

## ðŸ’¬ Feedback

Got ideas or suggestions? Iâ€™d love to hear them! This is a small side project â€” feedback, bugs, or feature requests are welcome.
- Right now, it doesn't recieve touch input, so it can only played with a mouse.
